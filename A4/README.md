::::: UPDATE :::::

calculator works with infix/postfix input w/ parenthesis support

there is a uml in each folder for reference

KNOWN ISSUES:
dealing with letters/unsupported symbols causes segmentation fault
inputting only numbers without operator causes segmentation fault












:::::OLD:::::

I was completely on the wrong track, so I decided to restart completely the day before the assignment was due.

There where too many files to manage, so I placed them into seperate folders based on what I was trying to do.

Creating the nodes and doing postorder traversal works completely fine without any known issues.

Everything has been tested rigorously.

The only pattern I didn't start was the Builder pattern because I ran out of time.

Ignore the data structures folder since I only had it there just in case I needed it.
